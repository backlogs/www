# Helping out

There's currently just two of us diligently plugging away to make Backlogs absolutely the best Agile tracking tool your money can't buy. But that's not to say we would turn down help if it was offered. There's something for everyone!

## Something broken? Please tell us

We're not perfect; as you're reading this, at least 400 changes have gone into Backlogs since we restarted the new branch. Something is bound to be broken at any given time, 
as we can't catch all the corner cases with the limited amount of time and test cases/test data we have available. 
So if something is broken, or you think of a way Backlogs could be even better than it is now, please let us know at the [bug tracker](https://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs/issues).

## We'd like to speak your language

We currently have translations for German, UK-English, US-English,
French, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch and Chinese.
Adding a new translation is fairly easy: grab one of the existing [translation files](http://github.com/backlogs/redmine_backlogs/tree/master/config/locales/) 
and replace the text after the colons.

## Have a story? Do tell!

The documentation is traditionally a weak point for many open-source projects. We'd love to include your story, to get better coverage in our documentation (since we're pretty experienced with 
Backlogs ourselves, it becomes progressively harder to write for newcomers), or just verbatim stories (we like praise!). So go ahead and let us know via [the forums](http://forum.redminebacklogs.net) 
or a [Twitter message](http://twitter.com/redminebacklogs).

## User Interface and JavaScript Jocks

We're always looking to make the user interface more efficient, and yes, more snazzy. If UI design is your thing, and you see something that could use some improvement, go right ahead! 
Also, everyone loves eyecandy. We don't want to diverge too far from the looks of Redmine, but we'd sure like it if people would say that Backlogs is hands-down the most beautiful plugin on the plugin list!

## Ruby, Rails, or Redmine developers

Backlogs builds on the awesome Redmine project management software, which in turn is built on the equally awesome Ruby on Rails framework. We can always use a hand building new features, 
or cleaning up old ones. If you can write code, but have no Ruby experience: picking up Redmine, Rails and Ruby should be a matter of weeks at most, and once you do, you'll probably never look back ;)

## Webmasters

We love open source. Heck, even this website is open source! If you want to help out in keeping the information here on the website current, you can start by forking [its code on Github](https://github.com/backlogs/www).
